## Description

This web page is intended to serve as the landing page for a future programming portfolio. It is also the first assigned independent project for the Epicodus _Intro to Programming_ course.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repo or download the project from http://github.com/lukebertram/portfolio
* Navigate to the project folder

## Known Bugs

I cannot figure out how to get the topmost text (Name and subtitle over the header image) to vertically align to the bottom of the container instead of the top.
