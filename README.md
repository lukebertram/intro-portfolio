# Portfolio Landing Page

#### A portfolio landing page, 10.13.2017

#### By **Luke Bertram**

## Description

This web page is intended to serve as the landing page for a future programming portfolio. It is also the first assigned independent project for the Epicodus _Intro to Programming_ course.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Clone the repo or download the project from http://github.com/lukebertram/portfolio
* Navigate to the project folder
* Open index.html in your web browser of choice

Additionally, the page can be viewed by simply visiting http://lukebertram.github.io/portfolio

## Known Bugs

I cannot figure out how to get the topmost text (Name and subtitle over the header image) to vertically align to the bottom of the container instead of the top. At this point, I'm not even sure if I want it down there anymore, but I'd sure like to see how it looks before I make the final call.
