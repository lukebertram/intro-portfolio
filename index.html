                <p>I studied Illustration at Boise State University and took a couple of introductory computer science courses toward the end of my time there. I enjoyed both fields of study and was fascinated by the areas where visual design and computer science overlapped, such as in the design of user experiences. However, I was unable to find a job working in either field at the time. So instead I spent five years working for my father's HVAC company, repairing and installing furnaces and air conditioners in Boise, ID.</p>
                <p>While I enjoyed certain aspects of working in HVAC, it was clear to me that I could not maintain a career in that industry for the rest of my life. After studying a little more about web development on my own (largely through <a href="http://learnenough.com"><em>M. Hartl's</em></a> tutelage), I decided to enroll in a code camp that would help me develop the skills necessary to work professionally as a front-end developer</p>

                <p>My <span class="hobby">hobbies</span> are varied and fluctuating, but some that I keep coming back to include:</p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <span class="hobby">Playing music</span> - whether it be on a guitar, electric piano, or original Nintendo Gameboy, I often entertain myself by arranging music-like sounds
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="hobby">Illustration</span> - throughout my life, I have always enjoyed creating images of wild and fanciful imaginings. Though I have used a variety of mediums, both digital and traditional, I most often fall back on the old ballpoint pen and paper to quiet my mind's hunger for doodling.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <span class="hobby">Electronic Video Games</span> - a curse I shall bear for the rest of my days. I may go months at a time without playing a video game, but I will invariably be drawn back to throw still more of my life into the black hole that is my insatiable thirst for electronic entertainment.
